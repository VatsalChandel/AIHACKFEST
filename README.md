# Sugar 
## In its purest form

This is a project that we did as part of the AI and accessibility hackathon at UW.

Our idea revolves around diabetes and how we can use AI to give users a more personal recommendation on how they should control their glucose levels. 

This web app uses Python as the backend and makes calls to ChatGPT and uses the information that the user gives, to give the user a better idea on how they can control their glucose levels. 

To run, do the normal git pulling stuff, and run app.py. There could be a potential error in the terminal when running that has to do with the database. In the case of this error, delete the instance folder and run app.py again.
